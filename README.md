# NewDadsApp


# Overview 
The New Dad’s App would be a place for new dads and old alike to come and give advice and support for each other. Often dad’s feel out of the mix with the first part of their parenting journey before the baby and even shortly after the baby comes along. Alot of focus and support is given to mom’s in that process (well their the ones carrying the tiny human anyway) but that can make their male counterpart feel useless or left out. With this app they will have a place to go and get advice, support, fun facts on how the development of their kids.
